# Fooder - Company Description

Fooder is a online-business focussing on providing healthy and cost-efficient food to its customers. 
At Fooder everything should be easy and good for the customers as much as it is possible. 
We provide recipes for food and build shopping lists for those recipes. 
Foodplans and diet-plans are a part of our business model. With Fooder-Premium we 
even provide you delivery-service for your groceries so that you dont need to shop them yourself. 
The Business is based on subscription-plans avaiable for three categories such as _Free_, _Member_ and _Pro_. 
With the _Free_ subscription one can only read recipes â€” _Member_ includes a shopping list and with _Pro_ one can use the delivery service too!
Of course, our food is only provided by local food producers and therefore also meets the requirements for organic food.

# Fooder - App
 
Right now, Fooder relies on handwritten meal plans and shopping lists, our goal is to digitalize the process instead. 
We want to provide digital recipes and the shopping list according to the recipes. 
Furthermore, we would like to include our community into this project and enable them to create their own recipes and shopping lists based on the recipes. 
Speaking of Community, we also want to enable _Social-Features_ such as Comments and a Rating-System in order to provide transparency and let the community interact with each other.

* The app should run at the domain `healthyfooder.de` with the title _*Healthy Food for your Lifestyle!*_
* The title should change based on categories like recipes or shopping lists.
* The color scheme should include the colors green, white and/or orange


# Required Use-Cases from us:

## Create a Account
A User should be able to create a new account with his login-name, E-Mail, password and has to decide for a subscription-plan (Free, Member and Pro) 
## Log-In to Account
A User should be able to login into his account with login-name or E-Mail and his password. After a successfull login, the user should be redirected to an overview page.
## Create a recipe
Users that are logged in should have the ability to create a recipe which consists of pictures (at least one), text (at least 500 characters) and a shopping list (at least two items).
## Show, save and like recipes
A User should see recipes from other users and should be able to save them in a "save-for-later" list and should also be able to give them a like to support the recipe and boost the popularity of its creator.
## Print shopping list based on recipe(s)
Every User should be able to retrieve a list for shopping ingredients based on his recipes. Pro and Member users should have the option to combine more than one recipe and the shopping list should automatically include all groceries for all recipes.
## Comment on and rate a recipe
At the bottom of every recipe should be a commentary section where one can comment and give between 1 to 5 stars for the recipe. Later on, it should also be possible to sort 
recipes based on their stars and recency.
## Edit your own recipes 
Selfmade recipes should be editable. Changing text or pictures should both be possible.
## Edit your own shopping-list
A shopping list should be editable in case something in the recipe changes. 
## Assign Category too Recipe
A recipe should have a category like (breakfast, lunch, dessert) so that users can search for a category and find better results.
## Combine recipes to menus
A user can create menus from recipes. Therefore we have 3 or 5 course-menus. e.g. a 3 course menu consists off starter, main course and desert. For successfully creating a menu, one needs to add a recipe from each category, otherwise the creation will fail.
## Show, save and like menus
Menus can be handled like recipes. They can also be seen by others, get saved and be liked. Comments could also be possible.
## Search recipes and menus based on tags 
Add tags to recipes like "vegan" or "cake" for search optimization. A tag can be predefined and choosen. Pro-Users and Admins can create new ones. 
The tags should help to filter recipes based on tags. For example, every vegan dish should have a "vegan" tag.
## Visit Accounts and see all recipes they created
A User should be able to click on other users and see all of his recipes. This is usefull in case you like a recipe from a person and want to see if he has other published items. 
## Set visibility for recipes
A User can define the visibility for his own recipes. There should be three options - published, hidden and deleted. A published recipe is visible for users. A hidden recipe is only visible for the creator and a deleted recipe is only visible for admins (deleted recipes can be instantly deleted or saved for admin-review before deletion).
