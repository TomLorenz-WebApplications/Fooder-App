# Fooder - Company Description

Fooder is a online-business focussing on providing healthy and cost-efficient food to its customers. 
At Fooder everything should be easy and good for the customers as much as it is possible. 
We provide recipes for food and build shopping lists for those recipes. 
Foodplans and diet-plans are a part of our buisness modell. With Fooder-Premium we 
even provide you delivery-service for your groceries so that you dont need to shop them yourself. 
The Business is based on subscription-plans avaiable for 3 categories such as _Free_, _Member_ and _Pro_. 
With the _Free_ subscription one can only read recipes â€” _Member_ includes a shopping list and with _Pro_ one can use the delivery service too!
Of course, our food is only provided by local food producers and therefore also meets the requirements for organic food.

# Fooder - App
 
Right now Fooder relies on handwritten meal plans and shopping lists, we want to digitalize the process instead. 
We want to provide digital recipes and the shopping list according to the recipes. 
Furthermore, we would like to include our community into this project and enable them to create their own recipes and shopping lists based on the recipes. 
Speaking of Community, we also want to enable _Social-Features_ such as Comments and a Rating-System in order to provide transparency and let the community interact with each other.
