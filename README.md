# Fooder - Company Description

Fooder is a online-buisness focussing on providing healthy and cost-efficient food to its customers. 
At Fooder everything should be easy and good for the customers as much as it is possible. 
We provide recipes for food and build shopping lists for those recipes. 
Foodplans and diet-plans are a part of our buisness modell. With Fooder-Premium we 
even provide you delivery-service for your groceries so that you dont need to shop them yourself. 
The Business is based on subscription-plans avaiable for 3 categories such as _Free_, _Member_ and _Pro_. 
With the _Free_ option one can only read recipes -- Member includes a Shopping List and with _Pro_ one can use the delivery service too!
Of course, every food we use is local and biological. 

# Fooder - App
 
Right now Fooder relies on handwritten meal plans and shopping lists, we want to digitalize the process instead. 
We want to provide digital recipes and the shopping list according to the recipes. 
However we would like to include our Community more and enable them to create their own recipes and 
of course write the shopping list to for those recipes. 
Speaking of Community we also want Social-Features there such as Comments and a Rating-System. 

The app should run at the domain :
* healthyfooder.de
with the Title :
* Healthy Food for your Lifestyle
The title should change based on Categories like recipes or shopping lists.
